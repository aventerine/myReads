# MyReads Project

Udacity Front End Nanodegree project. 

There are three bookshelves named currently reading, want to read, and read. The green arrow on each books allows you to move the book from one shelf to another. The green pplus at the bottom of the page takes you to theh search screen where you can search by author or title (see below regarding search terms).

## Instructions

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* if your default browser does not open after a few minutes, then open your browser and type `localhost:3000` into the address bar to view the app

## Backend Server

A backend server has been provided by Udacity.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
